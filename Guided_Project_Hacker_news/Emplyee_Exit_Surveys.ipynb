    "Even at the beginning, we can tell that there are a few problems that will need to be examined more closely or fixed. In the DETE survey, there are several columns with non-trivial numbers of null values. However, some of these may just indicate that the column was not applicable to the survey responder (e.g. \"Aboriginal\": 806 missing values or \"Disability\": 799. The TAFE has bigger problems, in my opinion, in that the column names are all questions and essentially unreadable as they stand currently. A potential solution will be to melt together columns that have the same overal topic."
